  <!-- TODO: I. INTRODUCTION TO BOOTSTRAP 5 -->
  <!-- ? 1. WHAT is Bootstrap
  Bootstrap 5 is a free and open-source front-end framework for designing websites and web applications. 
  It's the fifth major version of the Bootstrap framework, which is widely popular among web developers 
  for its responsive design features and user-friendly interface components.-->


  <!-- ? 2. WHY using Bootstrap
  Responsive Design: Bootstrap 5 provides a flexible grid system and pre-designed CSS classes 
  that automatically adjust your website layout to different screen sizes and devices (like mobiles, tablets, and desktops).

  Pre-designed Components: It offers a wide range of ready-to-use components 
  like navigation bars, dropdowns, modals, alerts, and more, which can greatly speed up the development process.

  Customizable: Bootstrap is highly customizable, 
  allowing developers to modify its default design to fit their specific needs.

  Cross-browser Compatibility: It ensures that your website works seamlessly across different web browsers.

  Community and Support: Being widely used, Bootstrap has a large community and extensive documentation, 
  making it easier to find solutions to common issues.

  No jQuery Dependency: Bootstrap 5 dropped jQuery as a dependency, 
  opting for vanilla JavaScript, which makes it lighter and potentially faster.-->


  <!-- ? 3. HOW to use Bootstrap 
  Add Bootstrap to Your Project:
    - Using CDN: The easiest way to start using Bootstrap is by linking to its CSS and JS files via CDN (Content Delivery Network) 
    - Download and Host Locally: Alternatively, you can download Bootstrap files and include them in your project directory.
  
  Learn the Grid System: Bootstrap’s grid system uses a series of containers, rows, and columns to layout and align content. 
    It's based on a 12-column system and is fully responsive.

  Use Bootstrap Components: Explore and implement various Bootstrap components such as navigation bars, buttons, forms, cards, etc., 
    by adding predefined classes to your HTML elements.

  Customization:
    Customize Bootstrap's default styles by overriding them with your own CSS.
    Use Sass variables and mixins for more advanced customization.
  
  Follow Documentation: Bootstrap’s official documentation is comprehensive and includes examples, 
    which is a great resource for learning how to use different components and utilities.

  Practice: The best way to learn Bootstrap is by building projects and experimenting with its various components and utilities.-->
