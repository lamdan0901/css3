  <!-- TODO: 1. CSS Pseudo-elements -->

  <!-- Pseudo-elements are like "virtual" elements in CSS 
    that allow you to style specific parts of an element, without having to add extra HTML. -->

  <!-- For example, you can use the ":before" pseudo-element to add a "fake" element before a real one, 
    like adding a fancy border before a paragraph, without having to add any extra HTML.
  Similarly, you can use the ":after" pseudo-element to add a "fake" element after a real one, 
    like adding a decorative symbol or a quotation mark after a paragraph. -->

  <!-- Some examples: ::before, ::after, ::first-letter, ::first-line, ::selection ...  -->

  <!-- TODO: 2. CSS Pseudo-classes -->

  <!-- Pseudo-classes in CSS are used to define a special state or condition of an HTML element 
    that cannot be targeted using just the element's name or class alone. 
    They allow you to style elements based on user interactions, element attributes, and other criteria -->

  <!-- Some examples: :hover, :active, :focus, :nth-child(), first-child, :last-child, :disabled ... -->

  <!-- Ref link: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_classes.asp -->

  <!-- <button> Hover Me</button>
  <button disabled> Hover Me</button>

  <a href="#">Click Me</a>

  <input type="text" placeholder="Type something">
  <input type="text" placeholder="Disabled Input" disabled>

  <ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
    <li>Item 4</li>
    <li>Item 5</li>
    <li>Item 6</li>

  <!-- TODO: 3. HTML Table  -->

  <!-- <table>: Defines the start of a table. Tables are used to display data in rows and columns.

    <thead>: Represents the table header section, which contains column headers.
    
    <tr>: Stands for "table row" and is used to define a row within the table.
    
    <th>: Represents a table header cell, which contains column headings or labels. They are typically bold and centered by default.
    
    <tbody>: Represents the table body section, which contains the main data rows.
    
    <td>: Represents a table data cell, which contains the actual data within the table. These cells are typically left-aligned by default. -->

  <!-- TODO: 4. CSS Display props  -->

  <!-- 
    display: inline elements flow inline with text and don't create line breaks. 
      Can not set width, height.
      Examples include <a>, <span>, and <em> tags.

    display: block elements create a block-level container that takes up the full width available and starts on a new line.
      Can set width, height.
      Examples include <div>, <p>, and <h1> tags.

    display: inline-block elements flow inline but can have block-level properties like width and height.
     It is a hybrid of inline and block elements.
     Can set width, height.
     Examples include buttons, images, and some form elements.

    display: none: elements are completely removed from the page's layout and becomes invisible.
      It doesn't take up any space, and it's as if the element doesn't exist in the document structure.
      It's often used to hide elements dynamically with JavaScript or to hide content for accessibility purposes.

    These display properties are essential for controlling how elements are laid out on a web page 
  and how they interact with other elements. -->
