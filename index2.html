  <!-- SASS/SCSS  -->

  <!-- TODO 1. Introduction to SCSS/SASS -->
  <!-- SCSS (Sassy CSS) and SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) are preprocessor scripting languages
  that are interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
  They provide mechanisms not available in standard CSS, such as variables, nesting, mixins, and more,
  which make your CSS more maintainable and easier to write. -->

  <!-- TODO 2. Variables -->
  <!-- Variables in SCSS/SASS allow you to store values that you can reuse throughout your stylesheet. -->

  <!-- TODO 3. Nesting -->
  <!-- Nesting is a handy feature that allows you to write your CSS in a way that mirrors your HTML structure, 
  which can make your code more readable. -->
