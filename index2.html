  <!-- SASS/SCSS  -->

  <!-- TODO 1. Introduction to SCSS/SASS -->
  <!-- SCSS (Sassy CSS) and SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) are preprocessor scripting languages
  that are interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
  They provide mechanisms not available in standard CSS, such as variables, nesting, mixins, and more,
  which make your CSS more maintainable and easier to write. -->

  <!-- TODO 2. Variables -->
  <!-- Variables in SCSS/SASS allow you to store values that you can reuse throughout your stylesheet. -->

  <!-- TODO 3. Nesting -->
  <!-- Nesting is a handy feature that allows you to write your CSS in a way that mirrors your HTML structure, 
  which can make your code more readable. -->

  <!-- TODO 4. Partials -->
  <!-- Partials are small SCSS files that contain snippets of CSS that you can include in other SCSS files. 
  This is a great way to modularize your CSS and make it easier to maintain. 
  A partial is named with a leading underscore (e.g., _reset.scss).
  This underscore (`_`) tells Sass that this file is a partial and 
  should not be generated into a CSS file when Sass is compiled.  -->

  <!-- TODO 5. Modules -->
  <!-- SCSS modules (introduced with the @use rule) let you encapsulate styles and only import what you need, 
  avoiding namespace collisions and providing better code organization. -->

  <!-- TODO 6. Mixins -->
  <!-- Mixins allow you to create reusable sets of CSS properties. -->
  <div class="box">this is the box</div>

  <!-- TODO 7. Extend/Inheritance -->
  <!-- This feature lets you share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another. -->

  <!-- TODO 8. Operators -->
  <!-- SCSS supports standard mathematical operators like +, -, *, /, and % for numbers. -->



  <!-- TODO Key Differences between Partials and Modules  -->
  <!-- 1. Naming Convention: Partials start with an underscore _, but modules don't necessarily have to.
  2. Compilation: Partials are not meant to be compiled to CSS files on their own, 
  while modules can be if they are not prefixed with an underscore.
  3. Import Method: Partials are imported using @import, while modules use the @use rule.
  4. Scope and Namespace: With modules, you get the benefits of scoping and namespacing, 
  reducing the risk of variable and mixin name conflicts across different files. -->
