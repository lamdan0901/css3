  <!-- SASS/SCSS  -->

  <!-- TODO 1. Introduction to SCSS/SASS -->
  <!-- SCSS (Sassy CSS) and SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) are preprocessor scripting languages
  that are interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
  They provide mechanisms not available in standard CSS, such as variables, nesting, mixins, and more,
  which make your CSS more maintainable and easier to write. -->


  <!-- TODO 2. Variables -->
  <!-- Variables in SCSS/SASS allow you to store values that you can reuse throughout your stylesheet. -->


  <!-- TODO 3. Nesting -->
  <!-- Nesting is a handy feature that allows you to write your CSS in a way that mirrors your HTML structure, 
  which can make your code more readable. -->
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">About</a></li>

      <article role="main">main article</article>
      <article role="complementary">complementary article</article>
    </ul>
  </nav>

  <!-- Avoid Deep Nesting: Try not to nest more than three levels deep.
  Deep nesting can create overly specific selectors which are hard to override and can lead to CSS bloat.
  
  Use Parent Selector Wisely: The & symbol is powerful but can lead to complex selectors
  if not used carefully.
  
  Readability: Always prioritize the readability and maintainability of your code.
  Nesting should make your code cleaner, not more complicated. -->


  <!-- TODO 4. Partials -->
  <!-- Partials are small SCSS files that contain snippets of CSS that you can include in other SCSS files. 
  This is a great way to modularize your CSS and make it easier to maintain. 
  
  A partial is named with a leading underscore (e.g., _reset.scss).
  This underscore (`_`) tells Sass that this file is a partial and 
  should not be generated into a CSS file when Sass is compiled.  -->


  <!-- TODO 5. Modules -->
  <!-- SCSS modules (introduced with the @use rule) let you encapsulate styles and only import what you need, 
  avoiding namespace collisions and providing better code organization. -->

  <!-- ? Key Differences between Partials and Modules  -->
  <!-- 1. Naming Convention: Partials start with an underscore _, but modules don't necessarily have to.
  2. Compilation: Partials are not meant to be compiled to CSS files on their own, 
  while modules can be if they are not prefixed with an underscore.
  3. Import Method: Partials are imported using @import, while modules use the @use rule.
  4. Scope and Namespace: With modules, you get the benefits of scoping and namespacing, 
  reducing the risk of variable and mixin name conflicts across different files. -->


  <!-- TODO 6. Mixins -->
  <!-- Mixins allow you to create reusable sets of CSS properties. -->
  <div class="box message">this is the box</div>

  <!-- ? Best Practices -->
  <!-- Clarity: Use mixins for code thatâ€™s repeated in multiple places.
  It makes your code easier to read and maintain.

  Performance: While mixins can help reduce repetition,
  using too many can increase your CSS size. Use them judiciously.

  Naming: Choose clear and descriptive names for your mixins.
  This makes your stylesheets easier to understand. -->


  <!-- TODO 7. Extend/Inheritance -->
  <!-- This feature lets you share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another.
  It's a powerful feature for keeping your CSS DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and organized, 
  but it should be used judiciously to avoid unintended side effects. -->

  <!-- Extending Placeholders '%'
  They are like classes, but they don't get compiled to CSS on their own. 
  They only get output when extended. -->

  <button class="button-primary">button1</button>
  <button class="button-secondary">button2</button>

  <!-- ? Best Practices and Caveats -->
  <!-- Overuse Warning: Overusing @extend can lead to complex, hard-to-understand style relationships
  and potential code bloat due to the generation of long selectors.

  Selector Specificity: Be mindful of selector specificity.
  Extending a complex selector can create overly specific rules and unexpected styles.

  Placeholders vs Mixins: Use placeholders when you want to share styles
  without producing additional CSS unless extended.
  Use mixins when you need to pass arguments or when extending would produce unwanted side effects.

  Maintainability: Ensure that your use of @extend doesn't compromise the maintainability of your code.
  It should make your codebase cleaner and more straightforward, not more complicated. -->

  <!-- TODO 8. Operators -->
  <!-- SCSS supports standard mathematical operators like +, -, *, /, and % for numbers. -->
